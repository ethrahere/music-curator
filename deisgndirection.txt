CURIO VISUAL IDENTITY DIRECTION

Theme: “Tactile Digital Radio”

🎧 Essence

Feels like tuning a beautifully crafted music device built in 2030 — matte, precise, physical, warm.

🧩 Design Language
Element	Direction	Description
Base Canvas	Off-white or soft gray (#f6f6f6 → #e8e8e8)	Gives that clean device surface feel instead of dark neon Web3 UI.
Depth System	Neumorphism + subtle shadows	Use soft extruded cards with 2 shadows: light top-left + dark bottom-right. This creates “physical” touch zones.
Accent Surfaces	Glossy buttons / knobs	Add 1–2 skeuomorphic elements — e.g. circular play button that feels like a brushed aluminum dial.
Typography	Mix of geometric sans + condensed monospace	e.g. Neue Montreal (titles) + IBM Plex Mono (metadata / track timers). Evokes radio interface precision.
Color Accents	Teenage Engineering inspired muted brights: coral, mint, mustard, sky blue	One accent per section; never full rainbow — keeps it mature.
Motion	Micro spring transitions; button presses should “sink”	Everything should feel pressable, not sliding. Slow hover shadows.
Sound Design (optional)	Subtle click/ping feedback	Like touching a physical synth knob. Adds subconscious premium feel.
🪩 UI Hierarchy Concept

Feed View

Feels like a grid of digital radio tiles

Each tile slightly raised, with a circular play “pad” and a small LED-style dot that glows when playing

Text: “Curated by @ethra” in small geometric font below

Now Playing Modal

Expands softly, as if pressing down a button

Center: album art with rounded bezel shadow

Below:

waveform (tiny glowing bars)

knob-like Tip and Co-sign buttons (skeuomorphic dials)

Background: matte surface with faint grain or paper texture

Curator Profile

Header like an instrument panel

Rounded info modules: total tips, co-signs, taste score

Each number shown on small 7-segment LED-style font

Scroll area below feels like flipping through radio stations (horizontal song cards)

🎚️ Visual Reference Anchors:

Teenage Engineering OP-1 interface

IKEA x Teenage Engineering Frekvens line

2000s Apple skeuomorphism (GarageBand / iPod scroll)

Dallo-style neumorphic concept you shared (for structure + light)

NTS Radio website (for layout rhythm)

🧠 Emotional Feel
Moment	Desired feeling
Opening app	“I’m inside a beautifully crafted digital device.”
Playing a song	“This feels like tuning into a hidden frequency.”
Tipping / co-signing	“I just pressed a real button; it clicked.”
Visiting curator profile	“This person’s taste is displayed like a record collection.”
⚙️ Implementation Notes

Use a light theme with matte grays as base (#f2f2f2, #ebebeb).

Implement dual shadows for neumorphism:

box-shadow: 8px 8px 16px #d1d1d1, -8px -8px 16px #ffffff;


Keep accent shadows subtle and high radius for soft depth.

Buttons: slightly raised; on press → inner shadow (“pressed in” look).

Use border-radius: 18px consistently — organic edges.

Consider adding subtle noise texture overlay for analog feel (using CSS background-image: url(noise.png); opacity: 0.1).


CURIO DESIGN SYSTEM v1

Theme: Tactile Digital Radio
Mood Words: Premium · Playful Precision · Warm Minimalism

🎨 1. Color Palette
Role	Color	Hex	Notes
Base Background	Matte Soft Gray	#ECECEC	Feels like smooth device plastic. Not flat white.
Raised Surfaces / Cards	Light Neutral	#F6F6F6	For neumorphic panels.
Pressed Surfaces / Shadows	Soft Gray	#D9D9D9	Used for inner shadows.
Accent 1	Muted Coral	#F36C5B	Primary highlight (buttons, icons).
Accent 2	Mint Green	#B8E1C2	Optional alt accent for secondary modules.
Accent 3	Warm Mustard	#EFBF56	For tips, badges, and interaction glow.
Text Primary	Charcoal Gray	#2E2E2E	High contrast but not black.
Text Secondary	Warm Gray	#5E5E5E	Subtle metadata and UI copy.
Highlight Glow	Neon Off-White	#FFFDF7	Used for light reflections or LED dots.

💡 Rule: Never use more than 2 accent colors on a single screen.
This keeps it feeling premium, not playful.

🧱 2. Shadows & Depth (Neumorphism)

Use dual-direction shadows to simulate soft extrusion.

/* Raised Card */
box-shadow: 8px 8px 16px #d0d0d0, -8px -8px 16px #ffffff;
border-radius: 18px;

/* Pressed Button (active state) */
box-shadow: inset 8px 8px 16px #d0d0d0, inset -8px -8px 16px #ffffff;
border-radius: 18px;


Add tiny light speck noise texture overlay for depth:

background-image: url('/noise.png');
opacity: 0.08;
mix-blend-mode: overlay;

✍️ 3. Typography
Role	Font	Style	Use
Primary Typeface	Neue Montreal or Satoshi	Geometric sans-serif	Headers, clean UI labels
Secondary Typeface	IBM Plex Mono or Space Mono	Monospace	Track timers, metadata, numbers
Fallback Stack	Inter, system-ui, sans-serif	—	For performance
Title Example	font-weight: 600; letter-spacing: -0.02em; text-transform: lowercase;		
Mono Accent Example	font-weight: 400; color: #5e5e5e; font-size: 0.85rem;		
🎛️ 4. Component Styles
Buttons (Tip / Co-sign / Play)

Shape: circular or rounded pill

Base: raised, light gray

Active: pressed in

Icon: minimal line or solid (e.g., Lucide icons)

Example (Tailwind-like):

.btn {
  background: #f6f6f6;
  border-radius: 18px;
  box-shadow: 6px 6px 12px #d0d0d0, -6px -6px 12px #ffffff;
  transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out;
}
.btn:active {
  box-shadow: inset 6px 6px 12px #d0d0d0, inset -6px -6px 12px #ffffff;
}

Cards (Song / Curator)

18–24px corner radius

Inside padding 16–20px

Optional small LED dot (accent color glow) when playing

Use drop-shadow + subtle noise overlay

Play Bar

Minimal horizontal track with soft highlight ring

Consider skeuomorphic knob for volume / scrubbing later

💫 5. Motion & Interactions
Element	Motion Type	Duration	Description
Buttons	Scale down on press	80ms	Feels physical
Cards	Elevate subtly on hover	120ms	Gives depth feedback
Play waveform	Looping ease-in-out pulse	1.5s	Feels organic
Modal open	Soft scale-in + fade	200ms	Like pressing a touchscreen panel

Subtle, snappy, tactile — not elastic or bouncy.

📻 6. Iconography & Micro Elements

Use monoline icons (Lucide, Iconoir) — 1.5px stroke.

Replace generic icons with audio-device metaphors:

Co-sign → small glowing LED dot or toggle switch

Tip → circular “coin insert” slot

Play → triangle carved into a round pad

🌈 7. Optional Upgrades

Add light ambient sound (a short radio static fade-in before song starts).

Add custom cursor — a small glowing dot with slight trail.

Use motion blur hover effect on album covers for premium tactility.
